    You don't need to know these advanced rules to enjoy Lost Branch of Legend.

    But, once you've played for a while...
    If you feel like you want to master everything this game has to offer, we invite you to read on!

ManaColor:
  Name: 'Mana Colors'
  Description: "The intent of this game's design was to interpret the characters of\
    \ Touhou with a colored mana system like that which is found in Magic: The Gathering.\n\
    There are 8 different mana types in the game.\n5 monochromatic colors: Red, Green,\
    \ Blue, White, Black, Colorless Mana which has no color and Philosopher's Mana\
    \ which can substitute for any color. Philosopher's Mana will not be a cost, while\
    \ Generic Mana in costs can be paid by any color and is represented by a number.\n\
    Some cards' costs require Colorless Mana, specifically.\nIt is important to mention\
    \ that Philosopher's Mana, being all colors at once, can be more powerful than\
    \ the Multicolored Lands of Magic in Magic: The Gathering. For example, if the\
    \ Player has the exhibit |Peony Stone| which requires Red Mana to be spent and\
    \ |Ice Cube| which requires Blue Mana to be spent, a single Philosopher's Mana\
    \ spent will be counted as the respective required mana spent for both exhibit\
    \ effects."

DamageType:
  Name: 'Damage Types'
  Description: "There are 3 types of damage: \"Attack Damage\", \"Direct Damage\"\
    \ and \"Loss of Life\".\nMost of the damage in the game is attack damage, affected\
    \ by things like Firepower, Weak, Burst, Graze, Accurate and more. Attack damage\
    \ is reduced by Block and Barrier. The visual animation is often a projectile\
    \ or laser.\n\"Direct Damage\" and \"Loss of Life\" are effects that do not interact\
    \ with most keywords; \"Direct Damage\" is also reduced by Block and Barrier,\
    \ but loss of life is not.\nIt would be cumbersome to list the first two types\
    \ of damage one by one, so the text will not make a distinction; basically, any\
    \ damage that is not done by attacks is \"Direct Damage\"."

CardPool:
  Name: 'Card Pool'
  Description: "You can only find cards in Card Rewards if they meet the following\
    \ criteria:\n1: The card's mana cost can be fully paid using mana in the mana\
    \ base.\n2: If it's a Unique card, it can only be found if you're playing as that\
    \ character, or if you hold one of their Shining Exhibits.\n3: Each of that card's\
    \ colors is present in your mana base. Philosopher's mana doesn't count toward\
    \ this rule.\n\nAs an example, say you're playing as Reimu and you hold Dark Grimoire,\
    \ Philosopher's Stone and Miracle Mallet. (You traded your Shining Exhibit to\
    \ Eirin...)\nThe mana base holds <sprite=\"ManaSprite\" name=\"W\"><sprite=\"\
    ManaSprite\" name=\"W\"><sprite=\"ManaSprite\" name=\"R\"><sprite=\"ManaSprite\"\
    \ name=\"R\"><sprite=\"ManaSprite\" name=\"B\"><sprite=\"ManaSprite\" name=\"\
    P\"><sprite=\"ManaSprite\" name=\"C\">. You can find cards Unique to Reimu and\
    \ Marisa, since you hold Dark Grimoire.\n\nIn this case, you can find a black\
    \ card that costs <sprite=\"ManaSprite\" name=\"B\"><sprite=\"ManaSprite\" name=\"\
    B\"> since you can pay <sprite=\"ManaSprite\" name=\"B\"><sprite=\"ManaSprite\"\
    \ name=\"P\"> to play it. However, you cannot find a blue and black card that\
    \ costs <sprite=\"ManaSprite\" name=\"U\"><sprite=\"ManaSprite\" name=\"B\">,\
    \ since there is no <sprite=\"ManaSprite\" name=\"U\"> in the mana base, even\
    \ if you could pay <sprite=\"ManaSprite\" name=\"B\"><sprite=\"ManaSprite\" name=\"\
    P\"> to play it.\n\nP.S.\nBlank Card, a Shining Exhibit, allows you to find cards\
    \ of any color.\nFor cards with mana value 5 or greater that have a generic mana\
    \ cost component (<sprite=\"ManaSprite\" name=\"1\">, <sprite=\"ManaSprite\" name=\"\
    2\">, etc.), only their non-generic mana cost will count toward rule 1. These\
    \ cards' mana costs can be reduced through effects."


BossLoot:
  Name: Boss Rewards
  Description: "When defeating a Boss, you are offered three different |Shining Exhibits|\
    \ as a reward. These |Exhibits| follow this pattern:\nThe rightmost |Exhibit|\
    \ is dependent on the Boss. In Act 1, it'll be one of the Boss's unique |Shining\
    \ Exhibits|, while subsequent Acts reward neutral |Shining Exhibits| based on\
    \ the boss's color (For example, Remilia would award a Red |Exhibit|).\nThe leftmost\
    \ |Exhibit| is dependent on your mana base. This |Exhibit| will always be a neutral\
    \ |Shining Exhibit| that grants mana of a color in your mana base and will be\
    \ a different color from the rightmost |Exhibit|.\nLastly, the middle |Exhibit|\
    \ will always be a neutral |Shining Exhibit| of a different color from the |Exhibits|\
    \ beside it, and can potentially be an |Exhibit| that does not add mana to the\
    \ mana base at all (like Imposing Oil Painting).\n\nIf the pool of possible |Exhibits|\
    \ to choose from in an Act has been exhausted, it'll be replaced by a random |Common|\
    \ to |Rare Exhibit| (You'll mostly see this after the Act 3 boss, for its rightmost\
    \ |Exhibit|)."
FriendCard:
  Description: "Here's some additional rules on Teammate cards to help smoothen the\
    \ gameplay experience with them.\n1. Exile is replaced by Ethereal.\nWhenever\
    \ a card effect would give a Teammate card Exile, it gives it Ethereal instead.\
    \ The same applies for removing Exile.\nAs Teammate cards are meant to be played\
    \ multiple times, them having Exile would be pointless.\n2. Whenever a Teammate\
    \ card with Ethereal is played, it loses Ethereal.\nIf a Teammate were to remain\
    \ Ethereal after being played, it would only activate its Passive Skill on the\
    \ turn it was summoned, which isn't desirable.\nSocial Butterfly specifically\
    \ mentions this, but this applies to all Teammate cards with Ethereal, regardless\
    \ of origin.\n3. Whenever a mid-combat Copy effect is used on a Teammate card,\
    \ summon status and Unity don't carry over to the Copy. Other attributes do carry\
    \ over.\nCopies of Teammate cards are always produced unsummoned and with their\
    \ base Unity value.\nThis is because summoned Teammates are somewhat similar to\
    \ other cards after being played, and being able to Copy them is an advantage\
    \ in it off itself.\nIf one were to copy a Teammate about to activate its Ultimate\
    \ Skill to activate that skill twice, it would mean having to limit how strong\
    \ Ultimate Skills can be, which goes against the spirit of such skills."
