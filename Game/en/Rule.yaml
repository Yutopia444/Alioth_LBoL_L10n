    You don't need to know these advanced rules to enjoy Lost Branch of Legend.

    But, once you've played for a while...
    If you feel like you want to master everything this game has to offer, we invite you to read on!

ManaColor:
  Name: 'Mana Colors'
  Description: "One of the goals behind the design of Lost Branch of Legend was to\
    \ combine the characters of Touhou with a colored mana system like that which\
    \ is found in Magic.\nThere are 7 different mana types in the game.\n5 normal,\
    \ single colors: white, blue, black, red and green, colorless mana which is no\
    \ color and Philosopher's Mana which is all colors. Generic mana in costs can\
    \ be paid by any color and is represented by a number.\nSome cards' costs require\
    \ colorless mana, specifically.\nIt is important to mention that Philosopher's\
    \ Mana, being all colors at once, can be more powerful than the multicolored lands\
    \ of Magic. For example, if the Player has the exhibit |Peony Stone| which requires\
    \ red mana to be spent and |Ice Cube| which requires blue mana to be spent, a\
    \ single Philosopher's Mana being spent will apply to both effects."

DamageType:
  Name: 'Damage Types'
  Description: "There are 3 types of damage: \"Attack Damage\", \"Direct Damage\"\
    \ and \"Loss of Life\".\nMost of the damage in the game is attack damage, affected\
    \ by things like Firepower, Weak, Burst, Graze, Accurate and more. Attack damage\
    \ is reduced by Block and Barrier. The visual animation is often a projectile\
    \ or laser.\n\"Direct Damage\" and \"Loss of Life\" are effects that do not interact\
    \ with most keywords; \"Direct Damage\" is also reduced by Block and Barrier,\
    \ but loss of life is not.\nIt would be cumbersome to list the first two types\
    \ of damage one by one, so the text will not make a distinction; basically, any\
    \ damage that is not done by attacks is \"Direct Damage\"."

CardPool:
  Name: 'Card Pool'
  Description: "You can only find cards in Card Rewards if they meet the following\
    \ criteria:\n1: The card's mana cost can be fully paid using mana in the mana\
    \ base.\n2: If it's a Unique card, it can only be found if you're playing as that\
    \ character, or if you hold one of their Shining Exhibits.\n3: Each of that card's\
    \ colors is present in your mana base. Chromatic mana doesn't count toward this\
    \ rule.\n\nAs an example, say you're playing as Reimu and you hold Dark Grimoire,\
    \ Philosopher's Stone and Miracle Mallet. (You traded your Shining Exhibit to\
    \ Eirin...)\nThe mana base holds <sprite=\"ManaSprite\" name=\"W\"><sprite=\"\
    ManaSprite\" name=\"W\"><sprite=\"ManaSprite\" name=\"R\"><sprite=\"ManaSprite\"\
    \ name=\"R\"><sprite=\"ManaSprite\" name=\"B\"><sprite=\"ManaSprite\" name=\"\
    P\"><sprite=\"ManaSprite\" name=\"C\">. You can find cards Unqiue to Reimu and\
    \ Marisa, since you hold Dark Grimoire.\n\nIn this case, you can find a black\
    \ card that costs <sprite=\"ManaSprite\" name=\"B\"><sprite=\"ManaSprite\" name=\"\
    B\"> since you can pay <sprite=\"ManaSprite\" name=\"B\"><sprite=\"ManaSprite\"\
    \ name=\"P\"> to play it. However, you cannot find a blue and black card that\
    \ costs <sprite=\"ManaSprite\" name=\"U\"><sprite=\"ManaSprite\" name=\"B\">,\
    \ since there is no <sprite=\"ManaSprite\" name=\"U\"> in the mana base, even\
    \ if you could pay <sprite=\"ManaSprite\" name=\"B\"><sprite=\"ManaSprite\" name=\"\
    P\"> to play it.\n\nP.S.\nBlank Card, a Shining Exhibit, allows you to find cards\
    \ of any color.\nFor cards with mana value 5 or greater that have a generic mana\
    \ cost component (<sprite=\"ManaSprite\" name=\"1\">, <sprite=\"ManaSprite\" name=\"\
    2\">, etc.), only their non-generic mana cost will count toward rule 1. These\
    \ cards' mana costs can be reduced through effects."
