    You don't need to know these advanced rules to enjoy Lost Branch of Legend.

    But, once you've played for a while...
    If you feel like you want to master everything this game has to offer, we invite you to read on!

ManaColor:
  Name: 'Mana Colors'
  Description: "The intent of this game's design was to interpret the characters of\
    \ Touhou with a colored mana system like that which is found in Magic: The Gathering.\n\
    There are 8 different mana types in the game.\n5 monochromatic colors: Red, Green,\
    \ Blue, White, Black, Colorless Mana which has no color and Philosopher's Mana\
    \ which can substitute for any color. Philosopher's Mana will not be a cost, while\
    \ Generic Mana in costs can be paid by any color and is represented by a number.\n\
    Some cards' costs require Colorless Mana, specifically.\nIt is important to mention\
    \ that Philosopher's Mana, being all colors at once, can be more powerful than\
    \ the Multicolored Lands of Magic in Magic: The Gathering. For example, if the\
    \ Player has the exhibit |Peony Stone| which requires Red Mana to be spent and\
    \ |Ice Cube| which requires Blue Mana to be spent, a single Philosopher's Mana\
    \ spent will be counted as the respective required mana spent for both exhibit\
    \ effects."

DamageType:
  Name: 'Damage Types'
  Description: "There are 3 types of damage: \"Attack Damage\", \"Direct Damage\"\
    \ and \"Loss of Life\".\nMost of the damage in the game is attack damage, affected\
    \ by things like Firepower, Weak, Burst, Graze, Accurate and more. Attack damage\
    \ is reduced by Block and Barrier. The visual animation is often a projectile\
    \ or laser.\n\"Direct Damage\" and \"Loss of Life\" are effects that do not interact\
    \ with most keywords; \"Direct Damage\" is also reduced by Block and Barrier,\
    \ but loss of life is not.\nIt would be cumbersome to list the first two types\
    \ of damage one by one, so the text will not make a distinction; basically, any\
    \ damage that is not done by attacks is \"Direct Damage\"."

CardPool:
  Name: 'Card Pool'
  Description: "You can only find cards in Card Rewards if they meet the following\
    \ criteria:\n1: The card's mana cost can be fully paid using mana in the mana\
    \ base.\n2: If it's a Unique card, it can only be found if you're playing as that\
    \ character, or if you hold one of their Shining Exhibits.\n3: Each of that card's\
    \ colors is present in your mana base. Philosopher's mana doesn't count toward\
    \ this rule.\n\nAs an example, say you're playing as Reimu and you hold Dark Grimoire,\
    \ Philosopher's Stone and Miracle Mallet. (You traded your Shining Exhibit to\
    \ Eirin...)\nThe mana base holds <sprite=\"ManaSprite\" name=\"W\"><sprite=\"\
    ManaSprite\" name=\"W\"><sprite=\"ManaSprite\" name=\"R\"><sprite=\"ManaSprite\"\
    \ name=\"R\"><sprite=\"ManaSprite\" name=\"B\"><sprite=\"ManaSprite\" name=\"\
    P\"><sprite=\"ManaSprite\" name=\"C\">. You can find cards Unique to Reimu and\
    \ Marisa, since you hold Dark Grimoire.\n\nIn this case, you can find a black\
    \ card that costs <sprite=\"ManaSprite\" name=\"B\"><sprite=\"ManaSprite\" name=\"\
    B\"> since you can pay <sprite=\"ManaSprite\" name=\"B\"><sprite=\"ManaSprite\"\
    \ name=\"P\"> to play it. However, you cannot find a blue and black card that\
    \ costs <sprite=\"ManaSprite\" name=\"U\"><sprite=\"ManaSprite\" name=\"B\">,\
    \ since there is no <sprite=\"ManaSprite\" name=\"U\"> in the mana base, even\
    \ if you could pay <sprite=\"ManaSprite\" name=\"B\"><sprite=\"ManaSprite\" name=\"\
    P\"> to play it.\n\nP.S.\nBlank Card, a Shining Exhibit, allows you to find cards\
    \ of any color.\nFor cards with mana value greater than 5 that have a generic\
    \ mana cost component (<sprite=\"ManaSprite\" name=\"1\">, <sprite=\"ManaSprite\"\
    \ name=\"2\">, etc.), only their non-generic mana cost will count toward rule\
    \ 1. These cards' mana costs can be reduced through effects."


BossLoot:
  Name: Boss Rewards
  Description: "When defeating a Boss, you are offered three different |Shining Exhibits|\
    \ as a reward. These |Exhibits| follow this pattern:\nThe rightmost |Exhibit|\
    \ is dependent on the Boss. In Act 1, it'll be one of the Boss's unique |Shining\
    \ Exhibits|, while subsequent Acts reward neutral |Shining Exhibits| based on\
    \ the boss's color (For example, Remilia would award a Red |Exhibit|).\nThe leftmost\
    \ |Exhibit| is dependent on your mana base. This |Exhibit| will always be a neutral\
    \ |Shining Exhibit| that grants mana of a color in your mana base and will be\
    \ a different color from the rightmost |Exhibit|.\nLastly, the middle |Exhibit|\
    \ will always be a neutral |Shining Exhibit| of a different color from the |Exhibits|\
    \ beside it, and can potentially be an |Exhibit| that does not add mana to the\
    \ mana base at all (like Imposing Oil Painting).\n\nIf the pool of possible |Exhibits|\
    \ to choose from in an Act has been exhausted, it'll be replaced by a random |Common|\
    \ to |Rare Exhibit| (You'll mostly see this after the Act 3 boss, for its rightmost\
    \ |Exhibit|)."
FriendCard:
  Description: "Here's some additional rules on Teammate cards to help smoothen the\
    \ gameplay experience with them.\n1. Exile is replaced by Ethereal.\nWhenever\
    \ a card effect would give a Teammate card Exile, it gives it Ethereal instead.\
    \ The same applies for removing Exile.\nAs Teammate cards are meant to be played\
    \ multiple times, them having Exile would be pointless.\n2. Whenever a Teammate\
    \ card with Ethereal is played, it loses Ethereal.\nIf a Teammate were to remain\
    \ Ethereal after being played, it would only activate its Passive Skill on the\
    \ turn it was summoned, which isn't desirable.\nSocial Butterfly specifically\
    \ mentions this, but this applies to all Teammate cards with Ethereal, regardless\
    \ of origin.\n3. Whenever a mid-combat Copy effect is used on a Teammate card,\
    \ summon status and Unity don't carry over to the Copy. Other attributes do carry\
    \ over.\nCopies of Teammate cards are always produced unsummoned and with their\
    \ base Unity value.\nThis is because summoned Teammates are somewhat similar to\
    \ other cards after being played, and being able to Copy them is an advantage\
    \ in it off itself.\nIf one were to copy a Teammate about to activate its Ultimate\
    \ Skill to activate that skill twice, it would mean having to limit how strong\
    \ Ultimate Skills can be, which goes against the spirit of such skills."
  Name: Teammate Cards
BattleFlow:
  Description: "Entering each combat, necessary enemies and cards will be initialised,\
    \ combat sequence will then be entered.\nAt the \"Start of Combat\" phase, most\
    \ enemies will apply their initial status, many other effects also resolve in\
    \ this phase, such as exhibit Tengu's Clog.\nThis phase is much earlier than \"\
    Start of Player's First Turn\", this is shown by Eiki Shiki and the final boss\
    \ performing multiple actions in this phase.\nAfterward, combat takes place over\
    \ multiple rounds until one side wins.\nEach Round consist of several Turns, with\
    \ each Turn corresponding to a particular Character. (e.g. \"Reimu's Turn\", \"\
    Rin Kaenbyou's Turn\")\n\nIn each Round, the Player has their turn in the Player\
    \ Phase first, then the enemy Characters have their turn one by one in the Enemy\
    \ Phase.\nGenerally, each Character only has one turn unless they have the \"\
    Extra Turn\" Status Effect.\nCharacters with Extra Turn will not pass their turn\
    \ when the that turn has ended, instead they take another turn.\nThis repeats\
    \ until the level of Extra Turn is depleted.\nOnce all Characters have finished\
    \ their actions, the round ends and a new round begins.\n\nAs of now, only the\
    \ Player can gain Extra Turns, with Inflation Square being the only exception.\n\
    In this case, each enemy will perform two actions consequitively (Their intent\
    \ will only show their first action).\nEach side has their own turn count, corresponding\
    \ to how many turns they have taken.\nGenerally, enemies have their turn count\
    \ match with the round count, while Players can have more than that due to their\
    \ access to Extra Turns.\n\nSome effect text refer to turns when the more accurate\
    \ term would be rounds, it's hard for newcomers to tell the difference between\
    \ a turn and a round.\nFor example, the status effects Vunlerable, Weak and Frail\
    \ only decrement at the end of a round, yet they also decrement when an extra\
    \ turn starts. (It is only with such complex presentations that the player experience\
    \ can be exactly how it should be)\n"
  Name: Combat Sequence & Turns
PlayCard:
  Name: Follow-Up Card Usage
  Description: "The Koishi character update introduced Follow-Up card playing. It\
    \ works as described below, though the specifics are subject to change as Koishi\
    \ gets updated.\n\n1. Playing a card normally and playing a Follow-Up card are\
    \ two different actions, similar to natural turns and extra turns, typically,\
    \ a Follow-Up card play will follow a normal card play.\n2. A Follow-Up card play\
    \ does not trigger effects that react to a normal card play, like enemy Remilia's\
    \ card count, counts of cards like \"End of Imperishable Night\", \"Drunk\", \"\
    Stunning Summer Ice\" and counts of exhibits like \"Silver Pocket Watch\".\n3.\
    \ Follow-Up cards played will priorities in following the targets of the normal\
    \ card play it follows, if the target is invalid, then a random target will be\
    \ selected. This mainly affects attack cards.\n4. Follow-Up cards do not consume\
    \ mana, but there are other effects that prevents the card from being played normally,\
    \ it will not activate, and will instead enter the discard pile. (Effects like\
    \ Unplayable, insufficient gold while the card has a gold cost, etc.)\n5. If the\
    \ Follow-Up card played has an effect cost, like \"News Fabrication\", these effect\
    \ costs would have been cancellable when the card is played normally, but if the\
    \ card is played as a Follow-Up card, it cannot be cancelled.\n6. Follow-Up card\
    \ playing will be cut off by the end of the battle, even if the card that would\
    \ be played has effects that would gain life or other similar effects.\n7. Interaction\
    \ with X cost cards: The Follow-Up card played will be treated as being played\
    \ with 0 cost."
PlayTwice:
  Name: Playing Cards Twice
  Description: "A special example of Follow-Up card playing is \"play twice\" from\
    \ card effects. It goes by the following rules.\n\n1.This is an effect that applies\
    \ to a normal card play, meaning if the card is played as a Follow-Up, it will\
    \ not be played twice.\n2.How it works in details: If a normal card play occurs,\
    \ if it would be played twice, a snapshot of the card will be created before the\
    \ card is played, after the card has resolved, the snapshot will be played, and\
    \ the snapshot will be removed from combat after use.\n3.The snapshot is different\
    \ from normal Copy cards, Copy rulings do not apply to the snapshot.\nPros for\
    \ the player: The player can use the Ultimate Skill of a teammate twice, use a\
    \ tool twice by just using one one Limited count, and can use \"Devour History\"\
    \ twice.\nCons for the player: A copy of the teammate cannot be obtained when\
    \ summoning a teammate, Growth on cards cannot be triggered twice.\nThe reason\
    \ why the handling here is different from Slay the Spire is because of the teammates'\
    \ presence, you for sure don't want to summon \"Daiyousei, Lively Assistant\"\
    \ only to immediately use her Active Skill.\n4.The player cannot obtain the snapshot,\
    \ or a copy of the snapshot.For example. when an Echo card is played twice, the\
    \ snapshot will not produce a copy.\n5.Interactions with Extra Turns: Snapshots\
    \ of \"Time Walk\" will not take effect, most other Extra Turn cards will gain\
    \ two extra turns, and only end the current turn. (Yet to determine if this is\
    \ too powerful)\n6.Interactions with X cost cards: Snapshots inherit the mana\
    \ paid to play for the original card, and there will be two full triggers."
