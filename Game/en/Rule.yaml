  Description: "You can only find cards in Card Rewards if they meet the following\
    \ criteria:\n1: The card's mana cost can be fully paid using mana in the mana\
    \ base.\n2: If it's a Unique card, it can only be found if you're playing as that\
    \ character, or if you hold one of their Legendary Exhibits.\n3: Each of that\
    \ card's colors is present in your mana base. Chromatic mana doesn't count toward\
    \ this rule.\n\nAs an example, say you're playing as Reimu and you hold Dark Grimoire,\
    \ Philosopher's Stone and Miracle Mallet. (You traded your Legendary Exhibit to\
    \ Eirin...)\nThe mana base holds <sprite=\"ManaSprite\" name=\"W\"><sprite=\"\
    ManaSprite\" name=\"W\"><sprite=\"ManaSprite\" name=\"R\"><sprite=\"ManaSprite\"\
    \ name=\"R\"><sprite=\"ManaSprite\" name=\"B\"><sprite=\"ManaSprite\" name=\"\
    P\"><sprite=\"ManaSprite\" name=\"C\">. You can find cards Unqiue to Reimu and\
    \ Marisa, since you hold Dark Grimoire.\n\nIn this case, you can find a black\
    \ card that costs <sprite=\"ManaSprite\" name=\"B\"><sprite=\"ManaSprite\" name=\"\
    B\"> since you can pay <sprite=\"ManaSprite\" name=\"B\"><sprite=\"ManaSprite\"\
    \ name=\"P\"> to play it. However, you cannot find a blue and black card that\
    \ costs <sprite=\"ManaSprite\" name=\"U\"><sprite=\"ManaSprite\" name=\"B\">,\
    \ since there is no <sprite=\"ManaSprite\" name=\"U\"> in the mana base, even\
    \ if you could pay <sprite=\"ManaSprite\" name=\"B\"><sprite=\"ManaSprite\" name=\"\
    P\"> to play it.\n\nP.S.\nBlank Card, a Legendary Exhibit, allows you to find\
    \ cards of any color.\nFor cards with mana value 5 or greater that have a generic\
    \ mana cost component (<sprite=\"ManaSprite\" name=\"1\">, <sprite=\"ManaSprite\"\
    \ name=\"2\">, etc.), only their non-generic mana cost will count toward rule\
    \ 1. These cards' mana costs can be reduced through effects."
