  Title: Note
  LoseShinning: You can always find cards exclusive to the character you're playing
    as, even if you lose their |Legendary Exhibit|.
  RollCard: "|Discoverable Cards through Card Rewards|\n\n You can only find cards\
    \ in Card Rewards if they meet the following criteria:\n 1: The card's mana cost\
    \ can be paid using the mana in the |mana base|.\n 2: If it's a Unique card, it\
    \ can only be found if you're playing as that character, or if you hold one of\
    \ their |Legendary Exhibits|.\n    3: Each of that card's colors is present in\
    \ your |mana base|. Chromatic mana doesn't count toward this rule.\n\n    As an\
    \ example, say you're playing as Reimu and you hold |Dark Grimoire|, |Philosopher's\
    \ Stone| and |Miracle Mallet|. |d:(You traded your Legendary Exhibit to Eirin...)|\
    \ \n    The |mana base| holds <sprite=\"ManaSprite\" name=\"W\"><sprite=\"ManaSprite\"\
    \ name=\"W\"><sprite=\"ManaSprite\" name=\"R\"><sprite=\"ManaSprite\" name=\"\
    R\"><sprite=\"ManaSprite\" name=\"B\"><sprite=\"ManaSprite\" name=\"P\"><sprite=\"\
    ManaSprite\" name=\"C\">. You can find cards Unqiue to Reimu and Marisa, since\
    \ you hold |Dark Grimoire|.\n\n    In this case, you can find a black card that\
    \ costs <sprite=\"ManaSprite\" name=\"B\"><sprite=\"ManaSprite\" name=\"B\"> since\
    \ you can pay <sprite=\"ManaSprite\" name=\"B\"><sprite=\"ManaSprite\" name=\"\
    P\"> to play it. However, you |r:cannot| find a blue and black card that costs\
    \ <sprite=\"ManaSprite\" name=\"U\"><sprite=\"ManaSprite\" name=\"B\">, since\
    \ there is no <sprite=\"ManaSprite\" name=\"U\"> in the |mana base|, even if you\
    \ could pay <sprite=\"ManaSprite\" name=\"B\"><sprite=\"ManaSprite\" name=\"P\"\
    > to play it.\n\n    P.S.\n    |Blank Card|, a |Legendary Exhibit|, allows you\
    \ to find cards of |p:any color|.\n    Cards with mana value 5 or greater and\
    \ have a generic mana cost component |d:(<sprite=\"ManaSprite\" name=\"1\">, <sprite=\"\
    ManaSprite\" name=\"2\">, etc.)| can still be found even if there isn't enough\
    \ mana in the |mana base| to play it. There are several ways to reduce the mana\
    \ cost of these cards."
