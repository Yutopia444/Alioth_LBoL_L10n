    |Touhou: Lost Branch of Legend| is currently in |d:Early Access|.
    Everything you see in this build may be subject to change!
    We're currently working on balancing cards and developing the third Act. The third Act will feature lots of |new foes| and more than 10 |new events|. After that, we'll work on |b:Cirno| and |g:Koishi|; as well as adding more dialogue and wrapping up story mode!

    If you have any problems with the game, feel free to ask for help in the |b:Steam Community Hub| or our |d:QQ group|. Our |d:QQ group number| is |209636617|.
    Please understand that we're unable to provide the same level of support as we can for our live-service games.

    Lastly, this is an |r:unofficial| |translation| by |Egg|. If you have any issues with wording, post about it in the |b:Steam Community Hub|.
